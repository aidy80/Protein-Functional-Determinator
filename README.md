# Protein-Functional-Determinator
Program to determine function of arbitrary protein based on their pfam domains 

Welcome to our program!

This directory is not able to be run on its own - it requires a much larger dataset of downloaded txt files that cannot fit on github
This includes the pfamseq file, uniprot_all_go.gaf, and Pfam-A.regions.tsv. However, hopefully the code still makes sense and you
can run it on your local machine if you would like (warning: This files together are roughly 150GB).
